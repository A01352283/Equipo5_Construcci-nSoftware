  description: The Gong is a slightly convex, round metal disk which is hit with
    a mallet. It originated in South East Asia, in particular China. It is a percussion
    sonorous or musical instrument of Chinese origin and manufacture, made in the
    form of a broad thin disk with a deep rim that has spread to Southeast Asia -
    a type of flat bell. It gradually found its way to Western Europe not only as
    an ornament to decorate the walls of well-to-do citizens, but also as an instrument
    in Western music. The Western gong may alternatively be called a tamtam.
