  description: The triangle is rarely viewed as a musical instrument that requires
    serious practice and study. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The tonal
    texture of a triangle is that of a special nature which cannot be imitated. The
    typical size goes from 6 to 9 inches. A good triangle has a wide range of overtones
    but no distinct pitch and is usually held by two loops.
